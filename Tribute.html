            <h2>About Susan B. Anthony</h2>
            <p>Susan B. Anthony was an influential figure who did remarkable things. Here's a brief overview of her life and achievements.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Co-Founder of the National Woman Suffrage Association: In 1869, Susan B. Anthony, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). This organization played a crucial role in advocating for women's voting rights.</li>
                
                <li>Publishing "The Revolution": From 1868 to 1870, Anthony and Stanton published a weekly newspaper called "The Revolution," which focused on women's rights and issues, including suffrage, labor rights, and education reform.</li>      
                <li>Leading Suffrage Campaigns: Anthony was instrumental in organizing and leading numerous campaigns to promote women's suffrage across the United States, including speaking tours and lobbying efforts.</li>
                <li>Casting a Vote in 1872: In a bold act of civil disobedience, Anthony voted in the 1872 presidential election, leading to her arrest. Her trial drew national attention to the issue of women's suffrage.</li>
                <li>Key Role in Passage of the 19th Amendment: Though Anthony did not live to see the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, her decades of relentless advocacy and organizing laid the groundwork for this pivotal legislation that granted women the right to vote in the United States.</li>
